Strava shows you TSS and fitness curves, but I wanted to dig into the formulas, experiment with different calculations, and query my data in ways the app doesn't support. Building this gave me a deeper understanding of training science and a local archive of years of activity data I can explore however I want.`,

Flask + Jinja2 keeps the stack minimal and dependency-light. Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles over Mapbox because there's no API key to manage and no usage billing to worry about. GPS routes are downsampled to 500 points max to keep storage reasonable without losing visual fidelity.`,
